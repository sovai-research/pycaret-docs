# Python for Asset Management

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sovai 1.0 is now available**. `pip install sovai` to try it. Check out this example [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1\_H0sHYhzKGZDmgzrQLosuZAR3nOaL6CN?usp=sharing).
{% endhint %}

### Python-first solution for Asset Managers&#x20;

SovAI is a low-code **machine learning** and **data library** in Python that automates many machine learning predictions.&#x20;

The library can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient.&#x20;

The library comes preloaded with 10s of unique datasets like accounting data, ratio data, bankruptcy data, news-sentiment data.&#x20;

## Features

PyCaret is an **open-source**, **low-code** machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the hypothesis to insights cycle time in an ML experiment. It enables data scientists to perform end-to-end experiments quickly and efficiently. In comparison with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to perform complex machine learning tasks with only a few lines of code. PyCaret is **simple and** **easy to use**.

#### PyCaret for Citizen Data Scientists

The design and simplicity of PyCaret is inspired by the emerging role of **citizen data scientists**, a term first used by _Gartner_. Citizen Data Scientists are ‚Äòpower users‚Äô who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more expertise. Seasoned data scientists are often difficult to find and expensive to hire but citizen data scientists can be an effective way to mitigate this gap and address data science challenges in the business setting.

#### PyCaret deployment capabilities

PyCaret is a deployment ready library in Python which means all the steps performed in an ML experiment can be reproduced using a pipeline that is reproducible and guaranteed for production. A pipeline can be saved in a binary file format that is transferable across environments.

#### PyCaret is seamlessly integrated with BI

PyCaret and its Machine Learning capabilities are seamlessly integrated with environments supporting Python such as Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Alteryx, and KNIME to name a few. This gives immense power to users of these BI platforms who can now integrate PyCaret into their existing workflows and add a layer of Machine Learning with ease.

#### PyCaret is ideal for:

* Experienced Data Scientists who want to increase productivity.
* Citizen Data Scientists who prefer a low code machine learning solution.
* Data Science Professionals who want to build rapid prototypes.
* Data Science and Machine Learning students and enthusiasts.

### Time Series

PyCaret **new time series module** is now available in the `3.0-rc`. Staying true to the simplicity of PyCaret, it is consistent with the existing API and fully loaded with functionalities. Statistical testing, model training and selection (30+ algorithms), model analysis, automated hyperparameter tuning, experiment logging, deployment on cloud, and more. All of this with only a few lines of code. If you would like to give it a try, check out our official [quick start](https://nbviewer.org/github/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/examples/time\_series/forecasting/time\_series\_101.ipynb) notebook.



To use Sovai's python module you can install `SovAI`.

```
pip install sovai
```
