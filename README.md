# Python for Asset Management

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sovai 1.0 is now available**. `pip install sovai` to try it. Check out this example [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1\_H0sHYhzKGZDmgzrQLosuZAR3nOaL6CN?usp=sharing).

Welcome to the most user-friendly **machine learning** and **data library** for investment managers.

## About

SovAI was founded in 2021 by Professor Derek Snow, after recognizing that:

> * Quality academic research are not perculating fast enough to asset managers.
> * Fundamental investors have no readily available solution to apply machine learning.&#x20;
> * Boutique asset managers and family offices cannot afford in-house data-scientist.&#x20;

The expected milestones have been laid out as far back as 2021, we are fortunate enough to only rely on public funding, by not relying on any external funding we can assure our independence.&#x20;

The software is built by alumni from the Alan Turing Institute, the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance at Oxford University, and financial engineering graduates at New York University.

SovAI is and will remain the most robust and simultaneously most affordable subscription product on the market. This will be gauranteed with an anytime refund. Don't like the outputs? Get all your money back.&#x20;

Finally we have benefited from the input of the following four academic advisors that has been supporting us since the birth of SovAI.
