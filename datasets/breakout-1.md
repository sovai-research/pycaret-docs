### Computations

#### Custom Aggregates

We can use the inputs to come up with new aggregartes of the original input data, doing that we can come up with new indices. Here I have come up with a few new ones.&#x20;

```python
df_risks_agg = sov.compute('risk-aggregates', df=df_risks)
```

### Prediction Model for Price Increases

This document outlines the prediction model used to forecast stock price movements. The model employs a variety of machine learning techniques and is optimized for equity selection. With an emphasis on pricing information, it is designed to predict significant price increases with high accuracy.

### Model Description

The model is constructed using a series of Python-based machine learning algorithms, with data processing and feature engineering steps to prepare the data for analysis.

#### Data Preparation

Data is initially sourced from a BigQuery table containing historical pricing information, such as adjusted close prices and trading volume. The data is preprocessed to generate features that capture historical trends and patterns, including:

* **Return Features**: Percent changes in price and volume over specified time windows.
* **Rolling Features**: Rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, etc.) calculated over different periods to capture short- and long-term movements.
* **Date Features**: Time-based features to account for seasonal trends and temporal patterns.
* **Target Variable**: A binary classification target indicating whether the stock price will see a significant increase (`1`) or decrease (`0`) over a given time horizon.

#### Feature Engineering

The model includes extensive feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the training data:

* **Standardized Returns**: The return of a stock over a specified period divided by the rolling standard deviation of the return, offering a normalized measure of price movement.
* **Summary Statistics**: Aggregated metrics derived from the newly created lagged return features, providing a comprehensive view of recent price behavior.

#### Model Training

Several machine learning models are trained using the prepared dataset:

* **Calibrated Classifier**: A classification model trained on the engineered features to predict the binary target.
* **Proprietory Regressor**: A proprietory regression model is used to predict the probability of a price increase.
* **Conformal Regressor**: Used to provide calibrated confidence intervals around the predictions, offering an additional measure of uncertainty.

#### Model Usage

The model can be applied to new data to generate predictions for the likelihood of price increases. It utilizes the trained classifiers and regressors to provide both point estimates and confidence intervals for these predictions.



### Potential Use-cases

1. **Bankruptcy Prediction Analysis**: Offer insights into predicted corporate bankruptcies and identify key factors, clarifying main drivers across different cycles.
2. **Variable Impact Breakdown**: Analyze how each individual variable affects bankruptcy predictions, providing in-depth feature contribution insights.
3. **Temporal Feature Distribution Analysis**: Reveal how variables contribute to predictions over time, emphasizing key features in forecasting models.
4. **Feature Impact Visualization**: Highlights how different factors influence predictions.
5. **Correlation Discovery**: Identify stocks with similar bankruptcy probability trends, revealing correlated market behaviors.
6. **Probability Shift Overview**: Showcase changes in bankruptcy probabilities among correlated stocks, providing a comprehensive market perspective.
7. **Sentiment Inversion Analysis**: Convert bankruptcy predictions into positive sentiment indicators to gauge potential impacts on stock returns.
8. **Behavioral Similarity Mapping**: Locate stocks with similar behaviors to a selected reference, based on bankruptcy trends and PCA feature analysis.
