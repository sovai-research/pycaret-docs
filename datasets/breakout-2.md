2. **Risk Management**: By quantifying and forecasting risk, the database serves as a critical component in the formulation of risk management policies for financial institutions.
3. **Economic Analysis**: Policymakers and economic analysts can leverage the insights to gauge economic health and prepare for potential market shifts caused by political or business developments.

### Key Components

#### Risk Indices

1. **Turing Risk Index**: A composite measure combining Market, Business, and Political Risks to provide an overarching view of the risk environment.
2. **Market Risk Score**: Evaluates the potential volatility and the downside risk within global markets using advanced statistical models.
3. **Business Risk Score**: Aggregates various measures of business conditions, sector sentiment, and economic indicators.
4. **Political Risk Score**: Measures the level of uncertainty in domestic and international policy-making spheres.



### Technical Use Cases

#### Market Dynamics
